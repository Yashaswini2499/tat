# tat
Tic Tac Toe in Java is a simple 3x3 grid-based game where two players (X and O) take turns marking empty cells. The goal is to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It uses arrays or 2D matrices, loops, and condition checks to track moves, validate input, and determine winners or draw efficiently.
